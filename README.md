# Medley [![Build Status](https://github.com/weavejester/medley/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavejester/medley/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Medley is a lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library of useful,
*mostly* pure functions that are "missing" from clojure.core.

Medley has a tighter focus than [flatland/useful][] or [Plumbing][],
and limits itself to a small set of general-purpose functions.

## Pre-1.0 Breaking Changes

In 0.7.0 the minimum Clojure version was changed from 1.5.1 to 1.7.0
to take advantage of [reader conditionals][]. The `update` function
has also been removed, as it is now present in `clojure.core`.

In 0.6.0 the type signature of `greatest` and `least` was changed to
be more like `max` and `min` in Clojure core. If you're upgrading from
a version prior to 0.6.0, please update your usage of `greatest` and
`least`.
